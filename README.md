# MinigameProject
<div>
 <h1>
  Project to learn more Unity, C#, Unity Muse and Github. 
 </h1>
Idea is to create multiple fast minigames with simple inputs to practice simple game mechanics and create some type of addicting loop to beat own records. Different difficulty levels added later for extra game loops. Inspired by WarioWare and some other classic platformer game mechanics like from Donkey Kong Country and Crash Bandicoot. Plan is to create all or most of the sprites and textures with Unity Muse AI tool. 

Idea is to make a WebGL build and then possibly a mobile version too with simple inputs.
