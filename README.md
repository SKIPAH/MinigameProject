# MinigameProject
<div>
 <h1>
  Project to learn more Unity, C#, Unity Muse and Github. 
 </h1>
 Inspired by WarioWare and some other classic platformer game mechanics like from Donkey Kong Country and Crash Bandicoot. Plan is to create all or most of the sprites and textures with Unity Muse AI tool. Idea is to create multiple fast minigames with simple inputs.
